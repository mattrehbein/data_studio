TO DO:

1. Draft final
	-text surrounding the compare chart
	-charts to add:
MAYBE CHANGE THE THREE CITY COLORS IN THE LAST GRAPH? MAYBE CHANGE THE FIRST GRAPH COLORS, TOO? (USE THE COLOR PAIRINGS WEBSITE I FOUND)



		1 ATL stacked bar of homicides, solved vs unsolved PDF
		2 ATL bar of clearance rates -- change to a line? PDF
		3 Line of atl and three other cities PDF
		4 Natl stacked bar, solved v unsolved PDF

2. Bring graphs into Ai and style them (red ATL, purp Bmo, blue Bos)
3. Finish/publish project page
4. Additional would-be-nice analysis: 
	-figure out a way to see what unsolved murder rate is of all cities for most recent year? Only those with sim pop?
	-figure out the code in pandas to see which city has comparable number of homicides as atl
	-Normalize the homicide rate by dividing by population, then multiplying by 100K



-make stacked bar graphs: bars of total homicides per year; stacked values = solved vs unsolved. Do natl. & atl
-histogram of unsolved by year? or maybe just plain bar of unsolved by year

-DETERMINE how to compare Atlanta to national level in best way poss -- does some national avg even make sense/would it be meaningful? Maybe better to compare to a city of comparable size population wise?

-SHOULD I REMOVE FROM DF THE FEW CASES THAT ARE NOT IN THE MURDER/NON-NEG MANSLAUGHTER CATEGORY?
