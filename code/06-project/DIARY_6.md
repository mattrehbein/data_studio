TO DO:
-figure out the code in pandas to see which city has comparable number of homicides as atl
-make compare graphs for baltimore and boston
-line graph with all three showing percent unsolved

-make stacked bar graphs: bars of total homicides per year; stacked values = solved vs unsolved. Do natl. & atl
-histogram of unsolved by year? or maybe just plain bar of unsolved by year


-Normalize the homicide rate by dividing by population, then multiplying by 100K
-DETERMINE how to compare Atlanta to national level in best way poss -- does some national avg even make sense/would it be meaningful? Maybe better to compare to a city of comparable size population wise?

-SHOULD I REMOVE FROM DF THE FEW CASES THAT ARE NOT IN THE MURDER/NON-NEG MANSLAUGHTER CATEGORY?
