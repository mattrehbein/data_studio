TO DO:
-make stacked bar graphs: bars of total homicides per year; stacked values = solved vs unsolved. Do natl. & atl
-histogram of unsolved by year? or maybe just plain bar of unsolved by year


-Normalize the homicide rate by dividing by population, then multiplying by 100K
-DETERMINE how to compare Atlanta to national level in best way poss -- does some national avg even make sense/would it be meaningful? Maybe better to compare to a city of comparable size population wise?

-SHOULD I REMOVE FROM DF THE FEW CASES THAT ARE NOT IN THE MURDER/NON-NEG MANSLAUGHTER CATEGORY?

WOULD BE NICE:
would be be poss to figure out which of the MAP entries are from the DOJ and which are the 27K they say they got through FOIA requests?
--> yes, this is easy; it's in the Source column, the values for which are either FBI or MAP. But none of the Atl PD homicides are from MAP
