TO DO:

1. Draft final
	-text surrounding the compare chart
	-charts to add:
MAYBE CHANGE THE THREE CITY COLORS IN THE LAST GRAPH? MAYBE CHANGE THE FIRST GRAPH COLORS, TOO? (USE THE COLOR PAIRINGS WEBSITE I FOUND)



3. Finish/publish project page
4. Additional would-be-nice analysis: 
	-figure out a way to see what unsolved murder rate is of all cities for most recent year? Only those with sim pop?
	-figure out the code in pandas to see which city has comparable number of homicides as atl
	-Normalize the homicide rate by dividing by population, then multiplying by 100K

-DETERMINE how to compare Atlanta to national level in best way poss -- does some national avg even make sense/would it be meaningful? Maybe better to compare to a city of comparable size population wise?
