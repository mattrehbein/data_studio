Realized error I had made in how I was looking at the refugee data: the yearly total is the population of refugees in the host country, not how many new refugees came to the country that year. That silly mistake led to fair bit of rethinking, as a lot of what I was planning to graph involved totalling the total pop column and analyzing the result by country.

As a way to make the analysis more interesting, today I pulled gdp data from the world bank, in order to see how it relates to Syrian refugee acceptance (how are the world's richest nations responding to one of the world's biggest and most publized crises?). Hoping a scatter plot will work well for that.


ERROR LOG:

-error reading in gdp csv. FIX: specified encoding="latin-1"
-repeatedly getting 'empty dataframe' error when trying to plot something. FIX: 






****ORIGINAL IDEA -- couldn't find data in form/categories I was envisioning, so dropped the idea for now.
Is poverty in the US "largely over"?

This has been a raging debate well before the White House released its report last week, but let's attempt to bottom line what some of the main numbers are to get a sense of what the debate is and so we can make up our own minds about it.

stats i can graph to measure poverty:
-poverty level, according to census
-poverty level, according to UN
-percentage of those with health insurance
-SNAP participation
-food scarcity
-child poverty
-racial breakdown of poverty
-fam v. single parent v. individual in poverty
-*****federal spending on safety net programs
