This has been a raging debate well before the White House released its report last week, but let's attempt to bottom line what some of the main numbers are to get a sense of what the debate is and so we can make up our own minds about it.

stats i can graph to measure poverty:
-poverty level, according to census
-poverty level, according to UN
-percentage of those with health insurance
-SNAP participation
-food scarcity
-child poverty
-racial breakdown of poverty
-fam v. single parent v. individual in poverty
-*****federal spending on safety net programs
