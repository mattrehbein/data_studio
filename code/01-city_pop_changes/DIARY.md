I didn't start this project diary till Saturday, but here's where I'm at now:

I think I now how to fix a problem I was having joining some additional data, so trying that first. If that works, my dataframe(s) -- imperfect as they may be -- should be final enough for this project.

Monday, 7/16

I did fix the problem with my joins. Looks like my final version of this project with involve four simple bar graphs: one for cities that lost the most people, one with unemployment rates for those cities, one for cities that gained the most people, and one with unemployment rates for those cities. Super basic and doesn't tell us a whole lot, but it was great practice going through the entire process and in firming up my understanding of some graphing fundamentals.
