At 33, LeBron James is 

TO DO:

1. Scrape MJ
2. make first graphs of lebron and mj comparison
3. Write and post pitch
4. determine five players to looks at: 1 MJ, 2 LeBron (to MIA or back to CLE), NEED 3, 4, 5
5. Scrape remaining players
6. **** Determine how each graph will look; how to compare the player's stats with their old team to those of their new team. Maybe just the side-by-side bar graph approach?
7. add columns to each set for championships and all-star selections
8. Datetime the year columns

****SHOULD ALSO CHECK TO MAKE SURE NUMBER OF MINUTES PLAYED DIDN'T DEC SUBSTANTIALLY WHEN COMPARING

POTENTIAL PROBLEMS:
-only doing regular season for now -- LeBron famously turns up his performance in the playoff, but haven't looked to see whether the numbers bear that out

Lay out will be break down of five players, selected based on their closeness of age, point average to LeBron now

maybe could do comparisons to players taht match his current situation in diff ways. for ex.

comparison one could be coming off the same point avg
comparison two could be going to a team with a comparable W-L year before the player arrived & and how many all-stars on the team


should probably note in the text of the piece how it's hard to compare LeBron to anybody bc he's LeBron but also bc the game has changed a fair bit -- players tend to be more all-around players, rather than defensive specialists, three-point specialists, etc


i think the comparison should be player's stats during entire tenure with the new team (AND ADD CHAMPIONSHIPS!!)

*** look at Jordan when he was LeBron's age -- probably won't be meaningful bc he didn't change teams, but if he was roughly same age as LeBron when he came back from baseball, that would work to compare


NBA stars who changed teams in their primes -- how they did after the change

--READ a bunch of ringer or other articles to get tone of an intelligent bball story
***have to specify how many years of stats after the change i will use -- first? avg of many?
***if look at one year, it would be ideal to include how many all-stars were on the team that year, as a measure of how much talent around him the player had
---that would be good, but really think it'd be better to look at total (avg) stats from entire tenure w/ new team, but try to compare moves with similar tenures time wise so it's more apples to apples
-from angle of LeBron, compare to five others maybe
