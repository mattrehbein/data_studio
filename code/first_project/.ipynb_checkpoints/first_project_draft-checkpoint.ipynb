    "# Which US cities Americans are fleeing -- and which are luring more\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I wanted to look at public housing in Atlanta -- and maybe it's affect on homelessness -- but after spending all of lab on Monday and a good chunk on Tuesday searching online and calling the housing authority, I abandoned this due to lack of data (or at least, a lack of ability to find it).\n",
    "\n",
    "I pivoted quickly to Census data on population change in US cities with 50,000 or more people. I searched for a table of what I wanted on the Census website and then exported it as a csv. I opened the csv in Sublime and chopped off a garbage topline of weird metavalues, then opened it here with pandas. I dropped columns I didn't need and renamed those I did. I also created a new column for state to have the option to do analysis at that level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results are actually marginally interesting, at least to me. Four out of the five that saw the biggest number drop in population are major American cities. Three out of the five that added the most are in Texas.\n",
    "\n",
    "My \"nice-to-have\" improvements would be more data and analysis: I'd like to try to get at why by probing number of jobs added (or lost) and other economic factors in the cities I'm looking at. I've also located Census on population change that compares the current number to 2010 levels, and the largest slice of time would likely produce more interesting results. More analysis would be needed of course to pay off/confirm using \"fleeing\" and \"luring\" in the above headline."
