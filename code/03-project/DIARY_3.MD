media criticism, lawsuits

Just over a month ago, a half dozen activist groups and four men sued the city of Chicago, its police department and various public officials over law enforcement's use of a database designed to track members of criminal gangs.

The federal class action lawsuit decries Chicago police's gang database as "arbitrary, discriminatory,
over-inclusive, and error-ridden." The four named plaintiffs deny being gang members and argue that their inclusion in the database has hurt their job prospects and led to harassment from police.

The Chicago police department released scrubbed versions of its gang database in November and again in March, according to ProPublica, which offers a free download of the database via its data store.

Analysis of the released information corroborates much of what the lawsuit alleges.

Racially and ethnically skewed

The Chicago police database includes more than 128,000 suspected gang members. About 70% of those individuals are black, 25% are hispanic ("white hispanic," as categorized in the database) and about 4% are white.

This is how the racial and ethnic divides in the police database compare to the Chicago's overall demographics. (Note that categories of race in the police database differ slightly from racial and ethnic categories defined by the US Census Bureau.)


The class action lawsuit argues that the police database "under-counts white gang members" by largely ignoring white supremacist groups and omitting biker gangs all together. It's unclear judging from only the names of the gangs listed whether biker gangs have been entirely excluded, but majority-white gangs account for a small portion in the police tally.

According to the database, black and hispanic members make up overwhelming majorities of the city's biggest gangs.

By comparison, the ten gangs with the largest percentages of white members make up just under a thousand of the suspected gang members in the database.


(NOTE: For clarity, two database entries with apparent typos have been combined with entries of the same name. For example, an entry under "White Supremist" was added to the group "White Supremacist.")

Last week Chicago Inspector General Joe Ferguson said his office is producing two reports about the CPD database, the first of which will be released by the end of the year, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

In April a CPD spokesman told ProPublica that the department was working on a plan to clarify guidelines for adding names to the gang database. The plan will also address which other law enforcement agencies have access to the database, as well as how individuals can seek to have their names removed from it, the spokesman said.

OUTDATED SECTION
The class action suit filed in June alleges that "once an individual is included in the Gang Database, he is in the database forever."


racially skewed, outdated, inaccurate

II.		racial/ethnic divide in gang db v city as a whole demographics
About 70% of the individuals included in the gang database are black, 25% are hispanic ("white hispanic," as categorized in the database) and about 4% are white.

II.		age of entries in the db (broken down by when added, per year) & age alleged gang members flaws
Giving police the benefit of the doubt that the 137 and 118 (CHECK EXACT) year-old gang members are typos, the database still contains X number of alleged gang members over the age of fifty, and X number over the age of x (60? 70?)

New graphs to make:
-line or bar of entries on the list over time

-side-by-side waffle charts of overall race breakdown, the database vs population of city in general


Problems:
data.gov dataset does not include info on whether the indexed crimes were gang-related.
