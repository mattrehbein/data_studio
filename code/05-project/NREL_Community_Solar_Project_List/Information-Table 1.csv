Community Solar Project List,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"This database represents a list of community solar projects identified through various sources as of Spring 2018. The list has been reviewed but errors may exist and the list may not be comprehensive. Errors in the souces (e.g., press releases) may be duplicated in the list. Blank spaces represent missing information. 

NREL invites input to improve the database, including to: 
- Correct erroneous information
- Add missing projects
- Fill in missing information
- Remove inactive projects

Updated information can be submitted to Eric O'Shaughnessy at eric.oshaughnessy@nrel.gov.",,,,,,,,
