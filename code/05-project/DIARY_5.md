How many community 'solar gardens' are there in the US?

How have they grown over time?

Where are they?

Could use the other data set that expresses potential of energy sources; think the estimate for community solar was small but might be interesting to look at.

Could even poke around a bit more and try to find db of rooftop solar and compare with community.

Solar Energies Industry Assoc
"About":
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA®) is the driving force behind solar energy and is building a strong solar industry to power America through advocacy and education. As the national trade association of the U.S. solar energy industry, which now employs more than 250,000 Americans, we represent all organizations that promote, manufacture, install and support the development of solar energy. SEIA works with its 1,000 member companies to build jobs and diversity, champion the use of cost-competitive solar in America, remove market barriers and educate the public on the benefits of solar energy.


PRIMARY DATASET (NREL) VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS
Variable descriptions								
Project Name	Project name, if applicable							

City	City where system is sited							

State	State							

Utility	Utility service territory							

System Size (kW)	System capacity in kilowatts. Most project capacities should represent rated capacity in kilowatts DC, but errors may exist.							

Year of Interconnection	Estimated year that project began serving customers.							

Co-located Projects	Some community solar arrays are co-located components of a larger project. If applicable, this field reflects  a single project name to link such co-located projects.		

Ciy Lat	Latitude of the city where the project is located (latitude does not represent the location of the project, but may be used as a rough approximation of project location for the purposes of geographic visuals)							
City Long	Longitude of the city where the project is located (latitude does not represent the location of the project, but may be used as a rough approximation of project location for the purposes of geographic visuals)
